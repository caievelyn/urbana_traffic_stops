# Civitas Project: Investigation into Racial Disparities in Traffic Stops by the Urbana, IL Police Department

Citizens regularly encounter police through traffic stops. In light of the evaluation of policing and its racial disparities, I worked with the Crime Analyst of the Urbana Police Department to determine whether there are racial disparities in traffic stops in Urbana, Illinois. 

This project explored data provided by the Urbana Police Department on traffic stop offenses from 2012-present (summer 2020 at the time). Recently, Mayor Marlin had expressed her commitment to reducing racial disparities in traffic stops. This project aims to look at the interaction between variables such as race and age on the likelihood of a driver getting stopped. It also seeks to explore whether recent policy changes have had a positive effect on racial disparities in traffic stops.
